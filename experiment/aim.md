## Aim

- To interface an LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino Uno to detect a specific temperature and use that signal to 
control a 12V DC motor and an LED through a 5V relay. The project also includes an LCD display to show the live
 temperature and device status.
 
## Objective
-	Understand the working principles of the LM35 temperature sensor.
-	Learn to interface an Analog sensor with an Arduino Uno.
-	Learn to control an LED using an NPN transistor.
-	Learn to connect and control a high-power DC motor using a low-power Arduino via a relay.
-	Program the Arduino to read sensor input and respond by controlling the DC motor and LED accordingly.
